## LOOP 0 — Deep research & identity (started 2026-07-17)
Goal: verified research digest, ADR-001/002/003, DHRUVA brand ceremony,
design-tokens.json, locked roadmap + MVP scope.
Exit gate:
1. Three scout RESEARCH reports on the blackboard with sources
2. ADR-001 (engine choice) and ADR-002 (app architecture) written
3. NAMING.md verification complete; name ratified in ADR-003
4. design-tokens.json committed at repo root
5. TASKS.md roadmap + MVP scope locked
Status: CLOSED 2026-07-17 — gate 5/5 on attempt 1.
Shipped: 3 research reports (orchestra/research/), NAMING.md, ADR-001/002/003
accepted, design-tokens.json, roadmap+MVP locked, both GitHub repos created and
pushed, agent roster in .claude/agents/.
Retro: (1) BIGGEST LESSON — haiku scouts hallucinate version numbers; every
version/package claim now requires orchestrator verification against pub.dev/
GitHub APIs before ratification (cost us one verification round on ADR-001; the
recommendation survived, the evidence didn't). (2) Reviewer critique of the
brand caught 6 real M3 completeness gaps — the critique-once ceremony step
earns its keep; keep adversarial review on every design artifact. (3) Running
designer/reviewer serially was the right call (shared file), but overlapping
Loop 1 scaffold work with the ceremony tail cost nothing — keep overlapping
non-conflicting work across loop boundaries. (4) Carry into Loop 1 prompts:
builders must consume design-tokens.json via the documented heightMultiplier
field, not recompute.

## LOOP 1 — Skeleton & org (2026-07-17)
Goal: both repos skeletoned, building, CI-gated, presentable.
Exit gate results (5/5, attempt 1):
1. flutter test green — PASS (local + CI)
2. flutter build apk succeeds — PASS (CI release build)
3. astro build succeeds — PASS (local + CI)
4. CI green on merged PR in BOTH repos — PASS (app#1, site#1 squash-merged)
5. README v1 + CLAUDE.md in both repos — PASS
Bonus: GitHub Pages LIVE at https://anshrajput.github.io/dhruva-website/ (200).
Shipped: Flutter scaffold (tech.appuinside.dhruva, strict lints, make verify),
app CI (format/analyze --fatal-infos/test+70% floor/android release/ios
no-codesign), Astro scaffold + Pages deploy pipeline, README v1, CONTRIBUTING,
issue templates, placeholder landing page.
Retro: (1) subosito/flutter-action + cache made CI fast enough — keep. (2) The
strict lint set caught real template debt (unsorted deps, import order) —
--fatal-infos from day 1 was right. (3) Placeholder page hardcodes two token
hexes (ponytail-marked) — Loop 12 must replace with token-fetch theming; risk
of drift accepted knowingly for 11 loops. (4) Carry into Loop 2: pin
llama_cpp_dart to an exact commit SHA in pubspec AND record it in DECISIONS.md.

## LOOP 2 — Engine online (2026-07-17)
Goal: real GGUF loads and streams through our abstraction, off root isolate,
working cancel, proven free path.
Exit gate results (attempt 2):
1. Debug chat streams completions on a desktop build — PASS (macOS dev target;
   real SmolLM2-135M, 64.9 tok/s Metal)
2. Engine unit tests green — PASS (39 tests: contract, adversarial QA,
   real-model smoke, RSS free-path incl. failed-ctx-create)
3. QA verdict — PASS (after BUG A/B fixes)
4. Reviewer verdict — APPROVE (after blocking leak fix)
5. CI green on merged PR — PASS (attempt 2; attempt 1 failed on coverage scope)
Shipped: EngineService abstraction + owned-isolate LlamaEngineService (typed
failure taxonomy across the isolate boundary, single stream error channel,
cooperative cancel via _GenGate, File-existence precheck), FakeEngineService,
debug chat harness, pinned llama_cpp_dart @ c6e377, macOS dev platform.
Retro: (1) BIGGEST LESSON — the pinned package's own LlamaEngine leaks
~167MB/reload; "verify the dependency's claims against its source" (Loop 0
lesson) paid off again at the code level: owning the isolate + reusing sync
primitives beat blind wrapping. (2) QA→fix→review→fix chain caught a real
mobile-OOM leak path the builder missed — the adversarial gate sequence is
worth its wall-clock. (3) Gate attempt 1 failure was self-inflicted: coverage
floor didn't implement §9's glue exclusion from day 1; scope rulings belong in
CI code the moment they're written down. (4) Docs-only pushes cancel in-flight
CI (concurrency group) — add paths-ignore for orchestra/** and docs/** in
Loop 3. (5) Carry into Loop 3: debug_chat's hard-wired concrete service made
it untestable — Loop 3+ features MUST take EngineService via Riverpod DI from
the first line.

## LOOP 3 — Model Manager & Hugging Face hub (2026-07-17)
Goal: browse HF GGUF repos in-app, device-aware verdicts, resumable verified
downloads, local import, storage manager.
Exit gate results (attempt 1 logically; 3 CI runs for env/target issues):
1. E2E download flow — PASS (real-socket localhost E2E over the real manager:
   search→detail→enqueue→range-resume→integrity→drift)
2. Offline/resume/corrupt states typed and tested — PASS
3. make verify + floor-scope coverage ≥70% — PASS (246 tests, 77%)
4. QA PASS + reviewer APPROVE — PASS (after 2 QA fixes + 2 review fix rounds)
5. CI green on merged PR — PASS
Shipped: DI root, device tiering, HfApiClient, drift store, DownloadManager
(sanitized choke point, restart rehydration with rebuild-before-flush
invariant, typed failures), storage manager, GGUF import, full models_hub UI
(license-before-download, verdict chips, retry affordance).
Retro: (1) BIGGEST LESSON — the reviewer caught the SAME bug twice at
different depths (restart orphan, then the fix's own flush-before-rebuild
race): ordering invariants around event streams need the invariant IN THE
INTERFACE CONTRACT, and a test that emits during the window; "verified
non-vacuous by inverting" is now the standard for race tests. (2) QA's
trust-boundary probe (path traversal) found a real gap the builders' 163
tests missed — adversarial QA stays mandatory. (3) Two CI environment
lessons: transient CocoaPods CDN failures (retry once before researching —
worked) and template deployment targets drifting from recorded decisions
(iOS 13.0 vs our 14+ floor) — decisions that imply build config must be
applied to build config the day they're made. (4) Carry into Loop 4: chat
consumes storageManager's ordered installed list + touchLastUsed; use
DownloadProgress.failure (typed) not errorMessage; designer gate is BLOCKING.

## LOOP 4 — Chat experience / MVP (2026-07-17) — v0.1.0-alpha SHIPPED
Goal: pick installed model → genuinely pleasant offline streaming chat. The MVP.
Exit gate (all met): MVP journey works on real engine (restart-persistence
proven) ✅ · designer SIGN-OFF (blocking) ✅ · QA PASS ✅ · reviewer APPROVE ✅ ·
CI green ✅ · v0.1.0-alpha tagged + distributed to internal-testers ✅
Shipped: full chat (streaming markdown/code, tok/s, reasoning collapse,
regenerate/edit, sampling sheet, folders/search, export), token-derived theme
+ bundled OFL fonts, Settings (clear-all + About page with ध्रुव + credit),
global download badge, recommended-for-device rail, Android AAR (chat-capable
APKs), engine multi-turn/seed/timeout. 463 tests, coverage 80.7%.
Beyond-scope this loop (human amendments 1-4): premium website live on Vercel
+ Pages, App Distribution pipeline proven, credit bar, continuous-ship rule.
Retro: (1) BIGGEST LESSON — three real-device/CI-only failures escaped 460+
green local tests: release-manifest INTERNET permission, Flutter version skew
(CI stable ran ahead of local, removed CupertinoPageTransitionsBuilder), iOS
deploy target. Local green != device/CI green. Actions: CI now pins Flutter to
local; distribute.sh exists; ADD to Loop 11 a "release-config audit" (manifest
perms, deploy targets, signing) and consider a smoke-install job. (2) The
human tester found the network bug in minutes — real-device distribution from
day one (amendment 4a) is worth its weight; keep shipping every loop.
(3) autoDispose on family providers is not optional on a memory-tiered app —
add to the architecture checklist so it's caught at BUILD not REVIEW.
(4) Six review/QA rounds (QA→fix→designer→fix→reviewer→fix) all found real
issues — the adversarial chain earns its cost on the flagship feature.

## LOOP 5 — Characters (2026-07-17)
Goal: create/edit/chat characters; 10 starters; community card import/export.
Exit gate (all met): CRUD+chat works, persona changes real-model behavior
(Captain Byte pirate vs neutral) ✅ · cards round-trip JSON+PNG ✅ · 10 starters
seeded ✅ · designer SIGN-OFF ✅ · QA PASS ✅ · reviewer APPROVE ✅ · CI green ✅
Shipped: drift v3 (characters + conversations.characterId, migration tested),
CharacterRepository + chatContextFor, TavernAI CharacterCard V2 interop
(JSON + pure-Dart PNG tEXt/iTXt chunk r/w, CRC32 pinned), gallery/create/edit/
detail UI, 10 built-in personas (region-safe guardrails), persona→engine
system-prompt binding (snapshotted at creation). 589 tests, coverage 79.8%.
Retro: (1) Untrusted-import trust boundary was the risk center — QA's HIGH
(sampling TypeError) + reviewer's zlib-bomb nit both lived there; lesson: any
"import a file from anywhere" feature gets an explicit adversarial-input pass
on EVERY field path, not just the happy parse. (2) Batching designer+QA
findings into one fix pass (vs serial) saved a round-trip — keep doing it when
both reviews land close together. (3) pumpAndSettle hangs on real dart:io
file I/O under the fake clock — established pattern now: unit-level repro for
I/O bugs, not settling widget tests. (4) Persona snapshot-at-creation (vs
live-link) was the right call — reviewer confirmed; document as the pattern
for Loop 7+ (vision/docs attaching context to a conversation).

## LOOP 6 — Voice (2026-07-18)
Goal: hold-to-talk STT, per-character TTS, hands-free conversation w/ barge-in.
Exit gate (all met): voice loop integration test (audio→transcript→chat→TTS) ✅
· voice models via Model Manager ✅ · hands-free turn-taking + barge-in ✅ ·
designer SIGN-OFF ✅ · QA PASS ✅ · reviewer APPROVE ✅ · CI green ✅
Shipped: sherpa_onnx 1.13.4 (STT+TTS+Silero VAD, real round-trip verified),
VoiceService w/ VAD-as-first-class-primitive, hold-to-talk composer, per-msg
TTS, hands-free state machine + barge-in, 4-model voice catalog (sha256-pinned)
via existing DownloadManager + zip-slip-guarded installer. 686 tests, cov 80.4%.
Retro: (1) BIGGEST LESSON — TWO mic-hot privacy races (dispose-mid-hold found
by QA, quick-tap-before-start found by reviewer) both slipped the builder AND
the layer that "fixed" the first one; async resource acquisition (mic/camera/
any capture) needs a release-requested pattern from the start, and tests that
DON'T await the acquire to expose the window. Add to arch checklist. (2)
Extending motion tokens (vs forcing a bad fit) kept the design system honest —
the right call when a real need doesn't match existing tokens. (3) Reviewer's
privacy-first lens on a capture feature earned its cost — the second race was
invisible to functional tests. (4) sherpa macOS codesign self-heal (R11) is a
dev-env quirk, not a product issue; on-device voice still needs a physical pass.

## UX-HARDENING LOOP (2026-07-18) — Amendments 5+6, shipped v0.2.0+21
Trigger: human tested distributed alpha on real Android — core broken (can't
chat, model needs restart to appear, no download feedback, "not usable").
Method change: unit-test-green was NOT proof; adopted real-component verification.
Diagnosis (4 parallel agents, orchestra/research/ux/): ROOT CAUSE = installed-
model providers never invalidated on download-complete → model invisible until
restart → can't start a chat / no model loads. SECOND root cause (why our first
hotfix "didn't work" on device): every build shipped as versionCode 1.0.0+1 →
Android kept the OLD APK on reinstall → user retested stale binaries.
Fixed + verified with REAL components on macOS: A1 invalidation (real
DownloadManager completion → model visible w/o restart, proven via real UI
E2E STEP1-5); real engine streams a real reply (unit test); Chat action carries
model (was landing in empty chat = "can't chat"); download-on-listing +
DownloadProgressRing (circular, ≥44px cancel, Semantics) + detail-tile feedback
+ OS notifications w/ progress + delete-on-listing + ranked/mobile/device-tiered
discovery + clear-all/new-chat refresh + first-run guidance. Version discipline:
0.2.0 + unique per-build number (git commit count); About shows version.
Riverpod KEPT (ruling upheld — all 4 diagnoses confirmed correct usage; the bug
was missing-invalidate, not the tool). make verify green (734 pass, 1 skip).
Retro: (1) BIGGEST LESSON — same versionCode across builds meant fixes never
reached the device; a real tester loop REQUIRES a monotonic build number from
day one. (2) unit tests with fakes read a provider directly and never proved the
real UI updates — the real DownloadManager→real-screen test caught what fakes
hid. (3) full-widget E2E can't pump the cross-isolate engine to a reply under
flutter_test — decompose: real-UI proves the state/visibility chain, real-engine
unit test proves the reply; device proves on-device inference. (4) OPEN: does
on-device arm64 inference reply? — awaiting human retest of 0.2.0+21.

## LOOP 7 — Vision (2026-07-18) — integrated onto v0.2.0
Goal: attach photos/screenshots to chat; on-device image Q&A; auto mmproj pairing.
Exit gate (all met): image→Q→A round trip (real SmolVLM: red→"Red.", blue→
"Blue.", "CAT"→"CAT") ✅ · mmproj pairing automatic ✅ · non-vision hides attach ✅
· designer SIGN-OFF ✅ · QA PASS ✅ · reviewer APPROVE ✅ · CI green ✅
Shipped: llama.cpp libmtmd via llama_cpp_dart (EngineLoadParams.mmprojPath,
ChatTurn.images, isMultimodal), drift v4 mmproj pairing + combined-size tier,
attach flow (gallery+camera, downscale, lightbox, extract-text), corrupt-image
+ GIF hardening. Merged cleanly with v0.2.0 hardening (both features intact).
819 tests. Parked mid-loop for the UX-hardening emergency, then integrated onto
the advanced main + all QA/designer fixes applied in one pass.
Retro: (1) Parking a mid-review loop to handle a critical user regression, then
integrating it onto the advanced main, worked — the merge was only 4 conflict
files and a clean schema v3→v4 stack; keep loops small enough that a later
rebase stays tractable. (2) Reviewer's merge-correctness focus (vs re-reviewing
the whole feature) was the right proportionate gate for an integration. (3)
Real vision test surviving the merge (re-run, not assumed) is what proved the
integration didn't silently break the feature.

## UX-CRASH-FIX loop (v0.2.3, 2026-07-18) — the video regression
Trigger: human recorded a screen video on build 0.2.2 (29) — app crashed 4–5×,
every download killed the app, no model ever installed, "really really
disappointed", "I don't want a dummy project". Analysed the video (52 frames +
audio transcript) into orchestra/VIDEO_FIXES.md.
Root cause (a regression I shipped in 0.2.2): the download fix
(Config.runInForeground = always) starts background_downloader's WorkManager
foreground service. On API 34+ it starts foreground with type dataSync, but the
app declared neither the FGS permissions NOR the dataSync foregroundServiceType
on androidx.work's SystemForegroundService → IllegalArgumentException
"foregroundServiceType 0x1 is not a subset of 0x0" → crash on every download.
Fix: add FOREGROUND_SERVICE + FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC; merge
android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync" onto SystemForegroundService via
tools:node="merge". Shipped with the dio migration + model-detail rework
(recommended-download-first) that were already on loop/ux-dio-detail.
Verified END-TO-END on emulator (API 36, arm64) BY ME before shipping: browse →
one Recommended download → ring fills 1→48→100% → installs → chat replies
on-device at 1.0 tok/s. No crash. Shipped v0.2.3 (33) to Firebase.
Retro / the lesson that matters: (1) The permission fix ALONE still crashed —
the dataSync service-type merge was the other half. I only found it because I
drove the emulator and read the actual crash, not because I reasoned from
source. On-device verification is now a hard gate in CLAUDE.md, not a nicety.
(2) The original 0.2.2 bug shipped BECAUSE I uploaded to Firebase without
installing it and tapping Download once myself. Never again — "test on-device
before every deploy" is locked into the goal. (3) The human's real ask is
bigger than any single bug: real value, end-to-end, not a playground. That's
now the north-star in CLAUDE.md. Remaining video asks (UI-match-website,
per-variant benchmark, download ETA, in-app Playground+AI-news, value-highlight)
are queued as the next loop(s).

## UI-PARITY loop (v0.2.4 + v0.2.5, 2026-07-18) — the rest of the video
After the crash fix, the human asked to "complete all" remaining video points.
Ran parallel builders (chat/voice UI parity, benchmark/ETA/value, playground) —
a git-stash race between concurrent agents on ONE shared checkout crossed their
working trees (rescued to .rescue-foreign/). Lesson: do NOT run multiple agents
mutating the same repo without reliable worktree isolation; isolation:worktree
mis-targeted the sibling website repo here. Recovered deterministically:
committed A + C, integrated, dropped the half-broken playground from v0.2.4.
Shipped v0.2.4: dark theme default, chat/voice website parity, per-quant quality
chips, download ETA/speed, in-app + website value copy. Then a SINGLE sequential
agent (no concurrency = no collision) finished the rest -> v0.2.5: playground
two-model compare + AI-news (fixed a subscription-cancel deadlock that stranded
model B's load), voice re-detects installed models without restart, voice STT
accuracy (Silero maxSpeechDuration 5s->20s stopped chopping sentences mid-word),
generation persistence (in-app leave/reconnect verified; true background-while-
minimised deferred to a foreground service, RISKS R12). Each verified on the
emulator before shipping; make verify green (840 tests). Retro: (1) one agent at
a time on a shared repo, or nothing. (2) Ship the verified subset, defer the
unverified feature (playground held out of v0.2.4) rather than ship red. (3)
On-device screenshotting caught what tests can't (dark theme, nav tab, empty
states) — kept as the release gate.

## PERF + IOS METAL + RENAME (v0.5.0, 2026-08-01)
Note: this entry covers the loops between the last LOOP_LOG entry and here
(KV-reuse perf, iOS Metal wiring, identifier rename); the v0.3.x-v0.4.x
release cycles in between shipped (see git log: v0.3.0, v0.3.1, v0.4.0,
v0.4.1, v0.4.2) without a corresponding LOOP_LOG entry — a logging gap, not
a functional one, flagged here rather than silently continued.
Shipped this loop:
(1) PERF — KV-prefix reuse across chat turns (loop/perf-kv-reuse, commit
7fdceae): the engine now reuses the KV cache prefix instead of recomputing
it every turn, plus context-shift (`shiftPolicy: auto`) and flash-attn/
KV-cache-quant knobs. Proven on the real engine (macOS, real SmolLM2):
prefix reuse measured cold=118 vs warm=17 decoded prompt tokens over a
4-turn conversation; `flashAttn=on + kvCacheQuant=q8_0` measured to halve KV
buffer size (2.99 MiB q8_0 vs 5.62 MiB f16 at 512-token context) and
complete generation successfully. Residual risks recorded as RISKS.md R13
(context-shift protects generation, not prefill-time overflow) and R14
(both wins proven on macOS only — Android/iOS on-device unverified, folds
into R1/R9).
(2) IOS METAL WIRING — the iOS build had zero llama.cpp engine wiring before
this loop (`app/ios/Podfile` never referenced the pod despite
`providers.dart`'s comment claiming it did — see
`orchestra/research/gpu-offload-gap.md` §2.2/§3.2, now superseded). Vendored
`llama.xcframework` at `app/ios/Vendor/llama_cpp/`, wired it into the
Podfile, fixed an arm64-only-simulator link failure, corrected the stale
"statically linked" doc comments. Real proof: `integration_test/
ios_engine_load_test.dart` drives a real model load + real `generate()` call
on the iOS Simulator, green twice. Full detail: DECISIONS.md "IOS METAL
WIRING". Real-device Metal perf/thermals remain unmeasured (RISKS.md R2).
(3) IDENTIFIER RENAME — Android's applicationId renamed
`tech.appuinside.dhruva` → `app.dhruva.mobile` to match iOS (which was
already on `app.dhruva.mobile` since Apple rejected the original ID). Old
installs do not upgrade in place; new Firebase apps created for both
platforms; old Firebase apps retained until testers migrate. Full detail:
DECISIONS.md "IDENTIFIER RENAME".
(4) SIGNING — Apple Developer account, `iPhone Distribution` cert, and the
`dhruva` ad-hoc provisioning profile are live and have already produced a
signed, distributed IPA. RISKS.md R2 corrected: the real residual constraint
is a one-device provisioning profile (add tester UDIDs to grow it), not "no
account" as the doc previously (and now falsely) claimed.
Shipped v0.5.0 (build 89) to Firebase App Distribution on both Android and
iOS — the first release where iOS ships a real, working engine rather than
failing to load.
Retro: the working tree that produced the live v0.5.0(89) builds was never
committed, so those builds are not reproducible from any commit in history —
this loop's own COMMIT phase (this entry included) exists specifically to
close that gap and redeploy from a clean, reproducible commit.
